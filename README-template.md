## My process
I made an index.css file to make it clear and do it better and made a lot of "div" and put classes for each of thoses to keep it really simple so I had no problem to specify something

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Swag';
    src: url(/fonts/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf);
}

```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

I would like to focus on doing faster, and cleaner, it may not be clean enough. I think i'm making it kinda harder and I overcomplicate things, maybe next time i'll do it better


### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - The basic w3schools always usefull if you need information about css or html
- [Tutorial on how to add a font](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAU25Fo4bFY) - If you don't know how to add a font it's pretty clear and easy to understand
